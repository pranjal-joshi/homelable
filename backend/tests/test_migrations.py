"""Backward-compatibility tests for the legacy → multi-design migration.

Simulates a database created by a pre-"designs" version of the app and asserts
that running init_db() adopts all existing nodes/edges/canvas into a single
default "Network Topology" design with no data loss. The rest of the test suite
builds the *current* schema via create_all and never exercises this upgrade
path, so this file guards real users upgrading in place.
